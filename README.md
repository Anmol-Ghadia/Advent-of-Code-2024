## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. These puzzles can be solved using any programming language, and they range from easy to very difficult. The puzzles are a great way to practice programming, prepare for interviews, or simply challenge yourself.
